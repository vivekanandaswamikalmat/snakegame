ABSTRACT

 The object of research is the complete cycle of software development - the computer game "Snake". The purpose of the course work is to systematize and generalize knowledge of C ++, obtained during the courses "Fundamentals of Programming", "Fundamentals of Programming", "Fundamentals of Software Systems Architecture" and "Fundamentals of Algorithm Theory" and familiarization with OpenGL technology.
     Based on the capabilities of the OpenGL graphics library and its extension, Freeglut was developed and debugged in C++ in Visual Studio 2017, which allows you to try the game "Snake" on your computer or laptop. Based on the capabilities of OpenGL, a user interface and game mechanics have been created. Object-oriented programming capabilities are used, the application consists of several modules.
As a result of the course work, the computer game "Snake" was created in the C++ programming language in 3D style. Developed software can be used for entertainment purposes as a computer game. To further develop the game, you can add new objects and structures, textures and new game modes.

INTRODUCTION

The objective of the game is to make the snake eat its food by rotating its head towards the food using arrow keys in keyboard, meanwhile as the snake eats more and more food it becomes longer and longer, one has to avoid the collision of the snake’s head to its body. The game will enter into next level as soon as the snake eats food five times. 
 
The basic features of the game were analysed to be: - 
 
•	A welcome screen which contains the title of the project (snake game), instruction to click on ‘s’ to start the game and the USN of the team members. 

•	Calculating the number of times, the snake has eaten the food and updating the score of the player while game is on.

•	Manipulating level according to the score and updating it on the display.

•	If the snake’s head touches its body, then the game should terminate.

CONCLUSION
 
We have attempted to design and implement a simple “SNAKE GAME”. OpenGL supports enormous flexibility in the design and the use of OpenGL graphics programs. The presence of many built in classes methods take care of much functionality and reduce the job of coding as well as makes the implementation simpler. 

The project was started with the designing phase in which we figured the requirements needed, the layout design, then comes the detail designing of each function after which, was the testing and debugging stage. We have tried to implement the project making it as user-friendly and error free as possible. We regret any errors that may have inadvertently crept in.
